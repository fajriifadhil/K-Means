My Activity is an application designed for tracking daily activities. With this app, you can keep track of which activities are overdue, upcoming, completed, and delayed. 

The main feature of this application is its ability to show you activities that have passed their due dates, activities that are scheduled for the future, activities that have been completed, and activities that are overdue. This ensures that all your tasks and responsibilities are well-managed.

My Activity provides useful reminders so that you don't miss important schedules or deadlines. With its intuitive interface and user-friendly design, you can quickly review your activity list and see the status of each one.

Not only that, but the app also allows you to add notes or additional details to each activity, so you can have more comprehensive and detailed information about what needs to be done. By efficiently recording your daily activities, you can better manage your time and enhance overall productivity.

With My Activity, you can become more organized and effectively manage your tasks, allowing you to achieve your goals and maintain a well-structured daily routine.
